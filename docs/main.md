## src/services/container.js

DI - Container. The exported container it self is NOT exported as a singleton. You need to take care about that your self.

**Examples**

```javascript
//Import the container
 import container from 'src/services/container'

 //Fetch a service from it
 const myService = container.resolve('myServiceName');
```
